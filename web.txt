The web works by having a lot of connections between many different kind of servers. First, you have your own personal computer. This is wher you house all of your personal information on your own machine. Your computer is connected toa router, which is a specialized computer that acts as a sort of hub for the computers in the immediate area (i.e. your house). That router talks to other routers connected to the same ISP yours is connected to. These share infomration about websites and how to access them.

All of the routers in the ISP are connected to eachother, and the ISP connects them to the servers located around the world. There are 13 ROOT servers that house most of the information on the internet. These servers contain the immediate infomration for websites, including their HTML, CSS, JS, and much mor einformation. This way, we don't have to save all of this info on our computers to access them.
